Abstractâ€” In this paper, we explore the problem of plant 
leaf classification using various machine learning algorithms, 
including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random 
Forest. Our dataset consists of features such as shape, texture, 
and margin of leaves belonging to multiple species, with the 
goal of accurately predicting the correct species given a new 
feature set (Shape, texture and margin). The paper describes 
the methodology that includes data exploration, preprocessing, 
model training, and evaluation. The models are trained and 
evaluated using cross-validation techniques, and their 
performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and 
F1-score metrics. Through our experiments, we demonstrate 
the effectiveness of Random Forest in achieving the highest 
accuracy of 91% among the three algorithms. We also 
investigate the impact of dimensionality reduction and 
hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA), Bayesian optimization, and Grid 
search on model performance. Our results show that these 
techniques can help to improve model performance while 
reducing the computational complexity of the models. Overall, 
our study provides insights into the potential of machine 
learning for plant leaf classification based on their shape, 
texture, and margin features, which can have important 
applications in fields such as agriculture and environmental 
monitoring.
